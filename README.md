# Virtual-Collisions-Lab
 This is a simulation of the [Conservation of Momentum lab](https://www.physics.ryerson.ca/sites/default/files/PCS120_ConsOfMomentum.pdf) from PCS 120.<br>
This was made as a proof of concept, regarding our solution for the [Virtual Physics Lab Challenge](https://www.ryerson.ca/ceie/the-design-challenge/)<br>

## Important Presets

- Friction is set to 0, to conserve momentum in the red cube - blue cube system
- The user set force is always applied over 1 second. 

## User Features:

- Set the mass,force,and initial position of both cubes
- Set the type of collision (elastic or inelastic)
